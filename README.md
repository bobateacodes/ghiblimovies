# ghiblimovies
This script allows you to Chromecast Studio Ghibli movies based on a curated list. As long as the video links are active, this script will work.
The script looks at the HTML of the embeded video, and pulls the Video URL (sometimes known as the download link/URL). With the video URL known, it casts to the nearest Chromecast on the network.
